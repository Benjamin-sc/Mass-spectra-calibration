# Mass-spectra-calibration
GUI that allow to load spectra measurement from an excel sheet and perform a mass calibration.


The interface looks like the figure below. The first section allows to load the data from an excel sheet. The "load spectrum button" open you folder window and you have to select the excel sheet that contains your datas. You have to specify the time column and row and the voltage column and row.

Then the spectrum is plotted. You can then save, zoom and move the spectrum. In the second section, you can enter several masses to calibrate clicking the button "Calibrate and plot". Finally the "save calibration" button allows to save the 2nd degree coefficient of your fit and the covariance matrix in a txt file.
